### 1. Resume Share
- Allows users to upload and share their resumes with interviewers for a more realistic interview experience.
- Resumes are temporarily available during the interview to reduce memory usage.

### 2. LinkedIn Connect
- Provides an option for users to connect with their mock interview partners on LinkedIn, fostering professional relationships post-interview.

### 3. Question Swap
- Enables interviewers to request additional questions during the session, offering flexibility and enhancing interview practice.
